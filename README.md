# Car Resale Value Prediction

With difficult economic conditions, it is likely that sales of second-hand imported (reconditioned) cars and used cars will increase. 
In many developed countries, it is common to lease a car rather than buying it outright. After the lease period is over, the buyer has the possibility to buy the car at its residual value, i.e. its expected resale value. 
Thus, it is of commercial interest to sellers/financers to be able to predict the salvage value (residual value) of cars with accuracy.

In order to predict the resale value of the car, we proposed an intelligent, flexible, and effective system that is based on using regression algorithms. 
Considering the main factors which would affect the resale value of a vehicle a regression model is to be built that would give the nearest resale value of the vehicle. We will be using various regression algorithms and algorithm with the best accuracy will be taken as a solution, then it will be integrated to the web-based application where the user is notified with the status of his product.

# Project Objectives
* To understand the problem to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.

* To know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.

* Applying different algorithms according to the dataset 

* To know how to evaluate the model.

* To build web applications using the Flask framework.

# Project Flow


* The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to enter the input features

* Entered input features are analyzed by the model which is integrated

* Once the model analyses the input, the prediction is showcased on the UI

To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below
Download the dataset.

1. Preprocess or clean the data.

2. Analyze the pre-processed data.

3. Train the machine with preprocessed data using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.

4. Save the model and its dependencies.

5.Build a Web application using Flask that integrates with the model built.
